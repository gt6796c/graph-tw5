# graph-tw5

# Simple Linear Graphing Library

place the <$graph> widget and then define a system of equations to graph

~~~~
<$graph colors='["red","blue","green"]' unitsPerTick="2" minX="0" minY="-6" maxY="6">
5 * Math.sin(x)
1/x
x*x+x
</$graph>
~~~~


An alternative method is to make the Tiddler type to be ``text/vnd.tiddlywiki.graph``.
